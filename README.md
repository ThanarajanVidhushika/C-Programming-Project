# C-Programming-Project
As an software undergraduate,this is a project done on the 1st semester of 1st year in order to address a real world problem using C programming language.

INTRODUCTION:-
  The University CGPA System project aims to address the real-world problem faced by the University Exam Division in managing and calculating Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPA) for its students. This system streamlines the process of collecting grades, calculating CGPA, and generating reports for students. By automating these tasks, the system aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in academic administration.
  
OBJECTIVES:-
 The objectives are to create a user-friendly interface for inputting student details and grades, implement algorithms for calculating CGPA, create a reporting system for individual students, and ensure data security and integrity in student records management.
 
SYSYTEM FEATURES:-
 I.	User Authentication: The system requires users to authenticate with a username and password to access its functionalities, ensuring security.
II.	Grade Input: Users can input grades and credits for each semester, allowing for the calculation of semester GPA and CGPA.
III.	CGPA Calculation: Algorithms are implemented to calculate CGPA based on grades and credits earned across multiple semesters.
IV.	Report Generation: The system generates CGPA reports containing student details, semester-wise GPA, final CGPA, and class classification.
V.	Data Persistence: Student records and reports are stored in files for future reference and auditing purposes.
VI.	Error Handling: The system includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and ensure data accuracy.
VII.	Distribution Signature: Students can provide a distributor signature, enhancing the authenticity of the generated reports.

SYSTEM DESIGN:-
 I.	User Interface: The system employs a command-line interface using standard input/output functions for user interaction.
II.	Data Structures: Arrays and strings are used to store student information, grades, and credits.
III.	File Handling: File handling functions are utilized to read and write student data and reports to persistent storage.
IV.	Algorithms: CGPA calculation algorithms consider the grade points associated with each letter grade and the corresponding credit hours.

CONCLUSION:-
 The University CGPA System developed for the University Exam Division provides an efficient and reliable solution for managing student academic records and calculating CGPA. By automating tedious administrative tasks, the system allows staff to focus on more strategic initiatives while providing students with accurate and timely feedback on their academic performance.
